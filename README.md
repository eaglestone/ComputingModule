# Computing Module Structure README file

##Introduction

The purpose of this structure is to provide a way for teachers to produce modules for teaching KS3 Computing in a consistent manner.

This means that theoretically different teachers at different schools can work on their own modules but then advertise that module on somewhere like the Computing at School forums.

Therefore if a teacher is new to Computing and struggling to find decent modules or if a teacher wants to see if a topic is already covered they can check CaS and download a module or write something else to fill a gap.

Please submit change ideas to the structure!  I would like to tailor it as much as possible.  There is also an ideas document here for future development of this structure.
